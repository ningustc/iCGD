# iCGD

This is a python version for the iteragrated constrained gradient descent method (iCGD).
The iCGD method we proposed is able to effectively applied to the correction of scanning positions in ptychography reconstructions. 
In addition, the idea of iCGD can be applied to the optimization of sample tilt, beam evolution (current fluctuation). 
Currently, the python code is temporarily provided, and we have a plan to release the CUDA code along with the iCGD protocols.
